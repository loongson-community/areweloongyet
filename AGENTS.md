This repository powers [*AREWELOONGYET?*](https://areweloongyet.com) (Chinese:
《咱龙了吗？》), the one-stop portal for following LoongArch upstream ecosystem
work. It is maintained by the Loongson open-source community.

**Before making any changes, read the contributing guide that matches the
predominant language of the current user session:**

- **中文会话** → [docs/contrib/agent-contributing-guide.zh.md](docs/contrib/agent-contributing-guide.zh.md)
- **English session** → [docs/contrib/agent-contributing-guide.en.md](docs/contrib/agent-contributing-guide.en.md)

If the session language is unclear, default to the Chinese version.

The contributing guide covers project structure, content workflows, code style,
commit message conventions, AIGC policy compliance, and the validation checklist.
All of those rules are authoritative and must be followed.
